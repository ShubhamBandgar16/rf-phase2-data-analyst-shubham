# 📊 Descriptive Statistics & Hypothesis Testing

## 🔹 Overview
Descriptive Statistics and Hypothesis Testing are fundamental concepts in data analysis and statistics. Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, while hypothesis testing helps make data-driven decisions by testing assumptions about a population.

Both are essential for Data Analysts to interpret data correctly and support business decisions.

# 📈 Descriptive Statistics

## 🔹 Definition
Descriptive statistics are numerical and graphical methods used to summarize and organize data so it can be understood easily.

## 🔹 Why It Is Used
- To understand the distribution of data  
- To summarize large datasets  
- To identify patterns and trends  
- To detect outliers  
- To support further statistical analysis  

## 🔹 Measures of Central Tendency
These describe the center of the data:

- **Mean** → Average value  
- **Median** → Middle value  
- **Mode** → Most frequent value  

## 🔹 Measures of Dispersion
These describe the spread of data:

- **Range** → Difference between max and min  
- **Variance** → Spread of data from mean  
- **Standard Deviation** → Square root of variance  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)** → Spread of middle 50%  

## 🔹 Data Distribution
- Normal Distribution  
- Skewed Distribution (Positive / Negative)  

## 🔹 Common Visualization Methods
- Histogram  
- Box Plot  
- Bar Chart  
- Pie Chart  

Descriptive statistics help in understanding “what the data looks like.”

# 🧪 Hypothesis Testing

## 🔹 Definition
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support or reject a claim about a population.

It helps answer questions like:
- Is a new product performing better?
- Has sales significantly increased?
- Is there a difference between two groups?

## 🔹 Key Concepts

### 1. Null Hypothesis (H₀)
Assumes there is no effect or no difference.

### 2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
Assumes there is an effect or a difference.

### 3. Significance Level (α)
Commonly set at 0.05 (5%).  
It represents the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis.

### 4. P-value
- If p-value < 0.05 → Reject H₀  
- If p-value ≥ 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀

## 🔹 Types of Hypothesis Tests

- Z-Test  
- T-Test (One-sample, Independent, Paired)  
- Chi-Square Test  
- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)  

---

## 🔹 Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. Define Null and Alternative Hypotheses  
2. Choose Significance Level (α)  
3. Select Appropriate Statistical Test  
4. Calculate Test Statistic  
5. Find P-value  
6. Make Decision (Reject or Fail to Reject H₀)

## 🔹 Why Hypothesis Testing Is Important

- Supports data-driven decisions  
- Validates business assumptions  
- Reduces decision-making risk  
- Measures statistical significance  
- Used in A/B testing, product analysis, and performance evaluation

# 📌 Difference Between Descriptive Statistics & Hypothesis Testing

| Aspect                  | Descriptive Statistics            | Hypothesis Testing                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Purpose                 | Summarize data                   | Make decisions about population     |
| Focus                   | What the data shows              | Whether results are significant     |
| Output                  | Mean, Median, Std Dev, Charts    | P-value, Test Statistic             |
| Decision Making         | Informative                      | Confirmatory                        |

## 🚀 Conclusion
Descriptive statistics help understand and summarize data, while hypothesis testing helps make statistically valid conclusions. Together, they form the backbone of analytical thinking and data-driven decision-making.
