# 🗄️ SQL Basic Queries for Data Analysts

## 🔹 Overview
SQL (Structured Query Language) is one of the most important skills for a Data Analyst. It is used to retrieve, filter, group, and analyze data stored in relational databases. These basic queries form the foundation of data analysis and reporting.

---

## 🔹 1. SELECT
Used to retrieve specific columns from a table.

Syntax:
SELECT column_name  
FROM table_name;

Example:
SELECT name, salary  
FROM employees;

---

## 🔹 2. WHERE
Used to filter records based on conditions.

Example:
SELECT *  
FROM employees  
WHERE salary > 50000;

---

## 🔹 3. ORDER BY
Used to sort data in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

Example:
SELECT name, salary  
FROM employees  
ORDER BY salary DESC;

---

## 🔹 4. GROUP BY
Used to group rows with the same values, usually with aggregate functions.

Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*)  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department;

---

## 🔹 5. HAVING
Used to filter grouped results (used with GROUP BY).

Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*)  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department  
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

---

## 🔹 6. Aggregate Functions
Used to perform calculations on data.

Common functions:
- COUNT()
- SUM()
- AVG()
- MIN()
- MAX()

Example:
SELECT AVG(salary)  
FROM employees;

---

## 🔹 7. JOIN
Used to combine data from multiple tables.

Example (INNER JOIN):
SELECT e.name, d.department_name  
FROM employees e  
INNER JOIN departments d  
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

---

## 🔹 8. Subqueries
A query written inside another query.

Example (Subquery in WHERE):
SELECT name  
FROM employees  
WHERE salary > (  
    SELECT AVG(salary)  
    FROM employees  
);

Example (Subquery in FROM):
SELECT department, AVG(salary)  
FROM (  
    SELECT department, salary  
    FROM employees  
) AS temp  
GROUP BY department;

---

## 🔹 9. DISTINCT
Used to remove duplicate values.

Example:
SELECT DISTINCT department  
FROM employees;

---

## 🔹 10. LIMIT / TOP
Used to limit the number of records returned.

Example (MySQL / PostgreSQL):
SELECT *  
FROM employees  
LIMIT 5;

Example (SQL Server):
SELECT TOP 5 *  
FROM employees;

## 📊 Why SQL is Important for Data Analysts
- Extracts data from large databases  
- Performs aggregations and calculations  
- Builds reports and dashboards  
- Supports business decision-making  
- Integrates with BI tools like Power BI and Tableau  

---

## 🚀 Skills to Master
- Writing efficient queries  
- Understanding joins clearly  
- Using subqueries properly  
- Handling NULL values  
- Optimizing query performance  

Mastering these SQL basics builds a strong foundation for advanced analytics and data-driven decision-making.
