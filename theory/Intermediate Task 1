## 1️⃣ What is the Total Sales and Total Profit of the Company?

### 🔹 Objective  
To measure overall business performance.

### 🔹 Theoretical Explanation  
Total Sales represents the overall revenue generated from all transactions.  
Total Profit represents the net earnings after deducting costs.

These two metrics help in:
- Understanding overall company performance  
- Evaluating financial health  
- Measuring business growth  
- Supporting strategic decision-making  

If total profit is significantly lower compared to sales, it may indicate:
- High operational costs

## 2️⃣ Which Region Generates the Highest Sales?

### 🔹 Theoretical Explanation  
By grouping sales by region, we determine which location contributes the most revenue.

This helps in:
- Identifying strong markets  
- Allocating marketing budgets efficiently  
- Expanding in high-performing regions  
- Improving strategies in low-performing regions  

If one region significantly outperforms others, the company may:
- Increase investment there

- Replicate strategies in weaker regions

## 3️⃣ Which Product Category is the Most Profitable?

## 4️⃣ Who Are the Top 5 Customers by Sales?

Top customers contribute significantly to total revenue.

This helps in:
- Building strong customer relationships  
- Offering loyalty programs  
- Providing personalized offers

Businesses often follow the 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle), where:
80% of revenue comes from 20% of customers.

Identifying top customers allows better customer retention strategies.

## 5️⃣ What is the Overall Profit Margin?

### 🔹 Objective

Higher profit margin means:
